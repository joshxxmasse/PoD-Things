Update 3-6
Fixes:
Sorc skill Thunder storm wasn't working as a named skill so that line has been removed from the orb and staff lines, just commented out it's own line and removed it from the display line
Sorc skills that fall under "+3 Misc" were causing ALL skills to be listed in the item name, this was fixed (needed an extra set of () to make them properly display)
Druid pelts were visible but missing the skill names from display, skills should show properly now (poor copy paste on my part)

Additions:
Added duplicate lines for Necro wands and heads, white/gray runeword bases; known good code using SKILL(##) has been preceeded by code using SKILL(NAME) instead. Lines using NAME should be gray in color, is they fail the ## lines should work fine but display in red indicating that the NAME lines didn't work right.
