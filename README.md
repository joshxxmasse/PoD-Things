# PoD-Things
*I made a couple tools in powershell to help me with editing wikitables on the PoD wiki page
*They're helpful to me, so someone else might  feel the same
*Both tools take inputs and return copyable code that can be pasted into the wiki sections
*There's a tool for skill descriptions, and a tool for patch note table making
